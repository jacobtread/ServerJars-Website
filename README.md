# Source Release

This is the source code of the website serverjars.com. This may not be entirely up-to-date with the current site 
however this is the most recent version I have before my credit was removed from the site. I found this while rummaging
through old USB sticks and im releasing this under the Un-license so anyone is free to use this source code for whatever
purposes they wish.

### Note
I wouldn't recommend using this design structure or way of storing data as using a database is much more efficient.
All the jars are stored in jars/mainCategory/subCategory/theJar.jar the site rescans these directories every 10 minutes to
check for changes

### Shell script
The shell script used to download the jars is located at BuildJars.sh
